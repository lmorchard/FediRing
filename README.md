# Fediverse Webrings

This is a half-baked idea to build a webring of verified fediverse profiles for whatever purpose one sees fit.

## TODO

- download and resize profile images locally during fetch rather than hotlinking

- support organizing profiles by tags, build tag pages

- accept import from
  - follows CSV export
  - Mastodon list CSV export
  - Mastodon list API (?)
