## What is this?

This is a collection of fediverse profiles, optionally verified by their owners.

Inspired by old-school [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring), you can wander through the collection to discover new denizens in the fediverse!

## Who manages this ring?

Les Orchard, resident of [hackers.town](https://hackers.town/@lmorchard), editor-at-large of [lmorchard.com](https://lmorchard.com)

## How does it work?

The manager of this ring maintains a list of fediverse profile addresses. 

From that list, a web site is generated, with a page devoted to each profile in the list.

From each of these pages, you can navigate to discover other profiles in order or at random.

When a fediverse profile links to their page in the ring, they appear as verified by the ring.

## How can I join the ring with my profile?

Get a hold of whomever manages the ring and ask nicely.

## If my profile is in the ring, how can I get verified?

[Add a link to your page in the ring to your fediverse profile metadata](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#fields).

Every page in the ring has a link back to the original profile [using the `rel="me"` attribute](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification).

## Who built the software that generates this web site?
